# NLP Text to SQL Generation

This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to convert natural language queries into SQL statements. The implementation uses advanced language models and NLP techniques to bridge the gap between human language and database queries.

## Project Overview

The project contains a Jupyter notebook (`NLP02.ipynb`) that demonstrates the implementation of text-to-SQL generation using NLP techniques. This notebook includes:

- Text preprocessing
- SQL query generation
- Model implementation
- Example queries and their SQL translations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (will be listed in requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shripoornasunilpetkar/NLP-Text-to-SQL-Generation.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd NLP-Text-to-SQL-Generation
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
